PROBLEM 2

 Step 1: Create three variables a, b, and c. Assign the values for a = 1001001001001, b= 12345567891, and c = 559922932941.

Step 2: Remove the last digit in a, b, and c.

Step 3: Multiply all the digits of each variable by 2.

Step 4: Continue this process until each variable becomes a single digit.

Step 5: Check whether the last digit of the default variable and the derived number is equal or not.

Step 6: If the derived number is equal to the last digit of the default variable, then print the number is valid, else print the number is not valid.

Step 7: STOP
