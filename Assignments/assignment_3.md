# _ASSIGNMENT 3_


## _OUTPUT:_

 1. Error because x is printed before it is declared.


 2.  Error because x is printed before declared 

 3. Error we are printing x before its declared


 4.  


 5.  Set in false branch
     Condition is false


 6. Outer loop: x = outer loop 0
    Inner loop: x = inner loop 0 in outer loop 0
    Inner loop: x = inner loop 1 in outer loop 0
    After inner loop: x = outer loop 0
    Outer loop: x = outer loop 1
    Inner loop: x = inner loop 0 in outer loop 1
    Inner loop: x = inner loop 1 in outer loop 1
    After inner loop: x = outer loop 1
    After all loops: x = global


 7. Start of iteration 0
    End of iteration 0
    Start of iteration 1
    End of iteration 1
    Start of iteration 2
    End of iteration 3
    Start of iteration 4
    End of iteration 4


 8.  Processing: x = outer, y = loop 0, z = item 1, i = 0
     Odd item: x = outer, y = odd item, z = item 1
     Processing: x = outer, y = loop 1, z = item 2, i = 1
     Even item: x = even item, y = loop 1, z = item 2
     Processing: x = outer, y = loop 2, z = item 3, i = 2
     Odd item: x = outer, y = odd item, z = item 3
     Result 0: Result for 1 at position 0: x = modified outer, y = odd item, z = item 1
     Result 1: Result for 2 at position 1: x = even item, y = loop 1, z = item 2
     Result 2: Result for 3 at position 2: x = modified outer, y = odd item, z = item 3

 9.  If block: x = 5, y = 10
     Nested if: x = 5, y = 10, z = 15
     After nested if: x = 25, y = 10
     After if-else: x = 25


 10. Inside loop 0: sum = 0
     Inside loop 1: sum = 2
     Inside loop 2: sum = 4
     Final sum = 0


 11. Error because value is called before its declared


 12. Inside function: x = 20
     After function call: x = 10


 13. Error because counter is called before its declared


 14. Error because title is used while declaring itself


 15. 


 16. Start of iteration 0
     Inner block: i = 0, j = 0
     End of iteration 0
     Start of iteration 1
     Inner block: i = 1, j = 2
     End of iteration 1
     Start of iteration 2
     Inner block: i = 2, j = 4
     End of iteration 2


 17.  Inside increment: count = 6
      Counter value: 0

 18.  Loop 0 – Before condition: value = outer
      Loop 0 – Odd condition: value = inner odd
      Loop 0 – After condition: value = outer
      Loop 1 – Before condition: value = outer
      Loop 1 – Even condition: value = inner even
      Loop 1 – After condition: value = outer
      Loop 2 – Before condition: value = outer
      Loop 2 – Odd condition: value = inner odd
      Loop 2 – After condition: value = outer
      After loop: value = outer


 19. 



 20. Loop iteration 0
     This is an even iteration: 0
     Loop iteration 1
     This is an odd iteration: 1
     Loop iteration 2
     This is an even iteration: 2


 21. Original multiplier: 2
     Result: [1, 4, 9, 16]


 22. Outer start: x = 20, y = 20
Inner: x = 30, y = 40
Outer end: x = 20, y = 20
Main end: x = 10, y = 20
