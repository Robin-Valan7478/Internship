# - __DAY 8 @ SURFBOARD PAYMENTS__


## - ___ALGORITHIMS:___
            - An Algorithm is a step by step method to solve a problem. It's like a basic instructions which will tells you exactly what to do, in what order by step by step.

            - We were given a task, We have to grab the soda bottle from back and bring it to the front. We have to write intructions for the given task. We have to write the instructions so that the a machine can understand. We have to write step by step instruction inorder to the machine can easily understand. 

            - We should give the instructions by easy steps. By mathematical thinking, We can give the instructions     easily instaed of giving it a complex one.



## -  ___FLUTTER:___

            - Flutter is an open source framework which is used to build apps. Framework means it is like a ready-made kit, instead of starting from scratch, we will get pre-build tools. Open source framework means it is publically         available.
            - Flutter was created by Google in 2017.

            - Flutter allowas users to create apps for android, iOS, web and Desktops using a single codebase. 

            - Flutter uses the Dart language and helps the developers create attractive apps quickly using pre-built    tools.

### - ___Difference between FLUTTER and ANDROID STUDIO:___

            - Flutter is a UI Framework for building cross platform apps, whereas Android Studio is an IDE (Intergrated  Development Environment) for native android app development. Native android app means,it is an application built specifically for android devices using official android development tools and languages like Java, Kotlin.

            - In Flutter, we can write code for Android, iOS, web, and desktops, whereas in Android Studio, we can write code only for android apps.

            - Flutter uses Dart language, whereas Android Studio uses Java and Kotlin.


### - ___Difference between FLUTTER and DART:___

            - Flutter provides all the necesarry tools and components for creating high quality apps.

            - Dart enables the integration of logic and behaviour in an app. we can use dart outside the flutter.  
            
            - Both Flutter and dart was developed by Google. 
    
            - In simple, Dart is a programming language and flutter is the framework that helps build apps using dart.


### - ___DART:___

            - Dart is an open source programming language used to build apps for mobile, web, and desktop

            - It was developed by Google and released in 2011.

            - It is used to create standalone programs.

            - Dart can be used to create apps for both android and iOS using the same codebase.

            - Dart is like the heart of flutter.

            - It is primarily used for frontend but it can also be used as backend.

### - ___ Basic Dart program to print Hello World:___

           `void main(){
                print("Hello World");
                }`

            Output will be Hello World


### - ___Variables in Dart:___ 

        - Variable is a named memory location that stores data, whereas data type defines the data that can be stored in a variable.

        - syntax : var data type
        - ex: var a; , var b =10; 


### - ___Data Types:___

        - It helps us to specify what type of value will be stored by the variable.
    
        - Dart supports the following built in data types

                - Numbers(int, double, num)
                - Strings(String)
                - Boolean(bool)
                - Lists(List)
                - Maps(Map)
                - Sets(Set)

                - Null(null)

        - ___Numbers:___
                - int -> represents a integer value.
                - double -> represents a decimal number.
                - num -> represents both integer and decimal value.

                - Syntax: 
                        `void main(){
                            int a=5;
                            double b = 2.5
                            num c = a+b;
                            print(c);
                        }`
                                                             Output - 7.5

        - These are the basic data types used in dart programming language.
