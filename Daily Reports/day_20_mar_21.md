## - _WHILE LOOP:_

        - While Loop will execute the code repeatedly as long as the specified condition remains true. we don't know the iterations.

        - While loop executes until the condition becomes false.

        - Syntax: 
                    while (condition) {
                        // statement
                        // increment/decrement
                        }

        - Example:

                int i =1;                        Output: 1
                 while(i<=5){                            2
                    print(i);                            3
                    i++;                                 4
                    }                                    5
                   }

        - In this example, initialization is given before the condition. The loop first checks the condition. If the condition is true, it executes the codes. Here, the conditipon is true, so it goes inside the condition and executes the code. It repeats this process until the condition gets false. After it becomes false, the condition stops. 


        - Learned about function declaration and calling and scope of a variable, like how a function works, where to use the function calling, where to declre multiple function nd call them accordingly. A variable decalred in a function is only accessible within the function. If a variable is accessed within the function the compiler first checks for the variable declaration and the value stored in referred address line. If it's not found inside the function scope it goes out of the function and checks for the variable. If the function is written inside a function, it checks for the value in the outer function. If the value isn't found in the outer function also it checks whether the variable is declared globally in the script if not it return undefined. If the function is not written inside any function then it directly look for a global scope variable outside the function, if not it returns undefined. Solved around ten programs. One example program,

        Ex:   int a=10;
              int b=20;
              int addition(int a,int b)    
              {
                return a+b;
              }
              int c = addition(a,b);
              void multiply(int c)
              {
                print(c*2);
              }
              multiply(c);


        - Here, we are declaring two functions one is for addition and another one is for multiplication, first we declared c as function calling and it goes to the function and returns the a+b value. Next it goes to the multiply function calling and goes inside the function. It performs the function and prints the value 60.



## - _FIREBASE in my FLUTTER APP:_  

        - I have designed a login page and now i am studying about authentication. I need to store the user data in firebase as a cloud storage. I have made a sign up page also. I need to make a aunthentication for both. For sign up page, I need to store the use ID and passowrd as an unique data. It will be assigned a unique key for each and every username and password. 

        - for Login page, We should check whether the given username and password is stored in our database or not. If it is stored go to home page of the app. If not send a error message "This account doesn't exist". 

        - I have created a project in the google firebase. I have also registered my android app in my firebase project. I have assigned authentication method using email id or google account. 

        - I have downloaded Android Studio latest version called Meerkat and it meets the minimum requirements like the target API should be atleast 21. I should have a physical android device or an emulator from android studio.


## - _SESSSION ON RESPONSIBILITY:_

        - Askin Anna gave a important session on Responsibilty. Whatever we do in our life, we should take responsible for that. We shouldn't put the blame on others, for this reason only I can't do it. Try to do it, Take responsibility and do the job. We shouldn't do it on obligation or guilt. If we do, It won't be good. It will not help us. be it in work life or personal life, we should do with an interest or love. If we do it with a guilt, obligation or for sake of others, it won't be helpful. Ownership is an important skill, we should take ownership on whatever we do, if not we will remain in the same place. We should be accountable whether it becomes succesgull or not.  We should be commited to that work.
