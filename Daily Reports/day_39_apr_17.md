# _DAY 39 @ SURFBOARD PAYMENTS_


## _MORNING SESSION:_


### _DATA MANAGEMENT:_

  - Data is simply known as digital Information. Data Management is simply known as how data is stored, arranged, organized, retrived, updated and secured on the server side of an appliaction. This is known as data management. It involves various processes and technologies to ensure data is accurate, accessible, secure and usable throughout its lifecycle.

 
### _DATA LIFE CYCLE:_

  - The data lifecycle refers to the stages that data goes through during its existence in a system from creation to deletion. If we understand this, we can easily manage data effectively. The stages are Collection data -> Organizing Data -> Storing the Data -> Securing the Data -> Using the Data.

  - Why Data Management matters? - Data management matters because data is the backbone of any application or system especially in the backend.A well managed data avoids duplication, errors and mismatches. We should encrypt the data and we shpuld have a proper file management to store the data. It boosts the app performance. It enables better decision making and improves security and privacy.


### _Core Principles and FAIR principles:_

  - Under Core Principles, It should gather only what we need, name spacing is very important and we shoud secure the data. 

  - FAIR principle:

   - Findable: Data should be easy to find by both humans and machines. We can use Unique Id's 
   - Accesible: Data should be retrievable using standard protocols
   - Interoperable: Data should work with other systems and formats, we should collaborate.
   - Reusable: Data should be well documented and it should be reused for future use.


### _DATA Protection: Backup & Security:_

  - Data protection is very important in backend development and it mainly involves two major aspects, one is data backup another one is security

  - If we have an important data, we should store it twice like we should store the data in local database as well as in cloud database. So that if data is deleted or hacked we can easily retrieve the data. So Data backup is v ery important.

  -  Data Security ensures only authorized users can access or mofiy the data. there are some key techniques like Authentication, Authorization, Encryption.


### _DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM(DBMS):_

  - A Database management System is a software that helps create, manage and interact with databse efficiently and securely. It allows developers and users to store, retrieve, update and delete data without directly dealing with how data is physically stored.

  - Some Key techniques of Database management is Data storage, Data retrieval, Data manipulation, Security and Authorization, Backup and recovery.

  - There are some types of database management System(DBMS), they are,

   - Relational Database Management System(RDBMS): It stores data in tables with rows and coloumns. Example: MySQL, PostgreSQL
   - NoSQL Database Management System: It is flexible, schema less storage. It is used for big data or real time apps. Example: MongoDB, Firebase
   - Hierarchial Database Management System: Data is stored in a tree like structure. Example: IBM IMS
   - Network Database Management System: It uses graph like structure with complex relationships. Example: Intergrated Data Store(IDS)


### _Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption:_

  - Symmetruc Encryption uses one single key for both client and server whereas Asymmetric Encryption uses seperate keys, such as it uses one key for encrytpting the data to cipher text and another key for decrypting the cipher text to normal text. 


### _Data Validation Techniques:_

  - Data Validation Techniques are used  to ensure that the input data is accurate, complete and useful before it's tored or processed. It is very important because we can easily avoid errors, maintain consistency and ensure data security.

  - Some Common Data Validation Techniques are,

   - Type Check: ensures the data is of the correct type.
   - Format Check: verifies if data matches a specific pattern.
   - Range Check: Ensures values fall within a specific range.
   - Length Check: Make sure input data has acceptable length.
   



  - I recapped what and all I have donw my Surfwall application and made some small changes to make it better.I was asked to study about firebase intialization and how I intergrated firebase with my App and how firebase works.  My task was to make a loading screen, So I researched about that and I started to write a seperate class for it. _
