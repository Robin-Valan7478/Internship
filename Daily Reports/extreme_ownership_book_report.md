# _EXTREME OWNERSHIP: How US navy Seals Lead and Win_ 

## _Introduction:_

  - Extreme Ownership is a book on leadership written by two US Navy Seals, _Jocko Willink_ and _Leif Babin_. The core idea of this book is To become a great leader, you must own everything in their world. _There is no one else to blame_ you should take responsibility. This is _Extreme Ownership_.

  - In this book, there are 12 chapters i.e., 12 leadership principles. After researching, each chapter follows a SCAL format -  Situation, Complication, Action and Learning. These 12 chapters are divided into three parts, the first four chapters is grouped into one part known as _Winning the War Within_, and the next four chapters are grouped into second part known as _Laws of Combat_ and last four chapters are gropued into third part known as _Sustaining Victory_. In this each chapter begins with a situation they encountered during the Iraq War and followed by a complication which requires urgent action to be taken, From the action taken, one of the leadership principle is highlighted.

  - The book's says without a team, there can be no leadership. The only meaningful measure for a leader is whether the team succeeds or fails. The best leaders are not driven by ego or personal agendas. They are simple focused on the mission and how best to accomplish it, and finally These leadership principles are simple, but not easy.


## _CHAPTER 1: Extreme Ownership_

  - This Chapter was written by _Jocko Willink_. He starts the chapter in the Mala'ab district in Ramadi, Iraq. The first chapter tells about a person should take extreme ownership of anything and that should be a important thing for them. In the early morning light, multiple US and Iraqi troops entered a heavily contested area of the city and among them, one is a SEAL sniper element under Jocko Willink's command.

  - Jocko Willink's said about how worse it is to be in a battlefield. Its like your death is coming near to you which can happen at anytime. One small mistake can make a huge loss. So decison making and taking responsibilty at that time is a huge thing. Imagine a soldier who was near by you gets shooted. I can't even imagine. Now only I undertsand how much struggles and challenges my dad has faced. He was in Indian Army for 15 years. He was in Kargil War. In that war, The militants were divided into teams and they were attacking the terrorists. My dad and 10 more soldiers were one team lead by a officer, they were near to the terrorists and his officer misguided them in the wrong path and at one moment my dad realized this and he took responsibility and told the soldiers to stay back. They weren't listening to him. Then, the 10 soldiers were attacked by terrorists and in that team my dad is the only one who survived from there. So, Taking responsibility at that moment is very tough. But even one small mkistake your life will be over. So being in a battlefield is never easy.

  - Likewise, In this battlefield also they were divided into groups and attacked from the different positions. But due to the communication problem, they thought the other team is a enemy team, So they started attacking each other. i.e., they are attacking their own teammates and Jocko Willink gets suspicious of the situation and ends up going in for a look himself together with one other US navy SEAL. He finds out that the building or army camp is his own SEAL sniper team. It's like they engaged on a blue-on-blue situation. In the heat of the battle, an Irqi Soldier with an AK-47 entered a building and they thought insurgent is coming and they shoot their own soldier. This is a _human error_ because of no proper communication with the teams about the troop positions not called in. 

  - But the real leadership starts here, how Jocko Willink's take responsibility is very good, he himslef admitted that this is his mistake on stage that when his team failed he's the one need to be blamed as a leader and took complete ownership for the incident. There also people admitted their mistake in that meeting saying they could have done better and they need to be blamed for it, those soilders also showcased extreme ownership like Jocko Willink did. Also Jocko  superiors who didn't punish jocko for what happened by realising that a leader like jocko is needed, who took complete ownership for the incident and let him continue his job and truely belived he will lead the team to victory. Then Jocko Willink also explained how did he taught the extreme ownership skill to a vice president of a company that's been doing bad in the market and the business. Inially the vp did resist and started blaming his employees for what happend and was convinced what happened is not his fault. Then jocok made him understand that when the vp is incharge of all this thinks and the whole unit he is blaming it's him who failed and the most importan thing is accepting it only then the vp took complete ownership of the situation. jocok also adviced him to take ownership and accept the his mistake in the meeting with his higher officials. Then the vp took full ownership only then he could think of solutions that could really help his company to be profitable again. He blamed the employees for the mistake and he beleived that he has nothing to do with it and he is doing it correct but when he take full responsibility and extreme ownership, he blamed himslef and he started to look for the solution. From this What I understand is instead of blaming others and beleiveing that this was thier mistake will do nothing, Only when we take full responsibility and ownership for the mistakes, we will eventually start looking for the solutions and we will be solving the mistakes. So Taking Extreme Ownership is not onlt for the leaders or higher officials evn the employees can take ownership and rectified the mistakes. We all are leaders in our life so we should take extreme ownership and take full responsibility for what we did instead of blaming others and beleiving we havn't done anything wrong. I will develop this extreme Ownership in my day to day life.


## _CHAPTER 2: No Bad Teams, Only Bad Leaders_

  - This Chapter was written by _Leif Babin_. The description of this chapter itself good i.ie., there is no such thing called bad teams, only a bad leader leds a bad team. So, because of a bad leader, even a good team can become a bad team but that doesn't mean that is a bad team, it's because fo the bad leader. It was the third night in the SEAL training, the students were  in aches and pains because they suffered through 72 hours straight of nearly nonstop physical extertion. He's currently assigned to instruct the Junior Officer Training Course and supporting SEAL training on the side as an instructor. Since Hell Week has begun, Dozen of the students quit and others had become sick or injured so they were also pulled out from training.

  - He shared about the tough Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL Training (BUD/S) class which is a test for a seal trainee mentally and physicaly and even trainees who tops previously strugless. During the fourth week of training, the students where divided into groups of _seven Boat Crews_. Each team had an rubber boat and in each of 7 boat crews the most senior ranked person will be the leader. Leif Babin noticed 2 teams, one team comes first while he other comes last always, he observed the crew 2 being perfomed better than other teams, the team members in the winning team supported each other and making up for each other's weakness. Where as in the other hand the boat crew 6 struggled to win the competition and always ended up in last, and coming last also has one problem, i.e., which team comes last will be punsihed and the punishment will defenitely be tough. The leader of the crew six blamed his teammates, because the teammates didn't paddle enough to win the competition. The leader of crew six was convinced that his team is loosing because fo his team mates doesn't paddle good and the teammates were also blaming each other for their mistakes. The navy seal instructor observed everything that's happening in the training. The instryctor asked the leader of crew six and he said his teammates is the reason they are loosing, so the instructor suggested swapping the leaders of this 2 teams. i.e., the leader of the loosing team goes to the winning team and the leader of the winning team goes to the loosing team. The cre six leader was very happy that he is going to a good team but the cre member weren't that happy, while the leader of crew two was also happy to face a new challenge and led a loosing team. Miraculously, after swapping the leaders, the loosing team immediately goes to the top  and coming first in all the exercises. The previus winnig team also continues to do well, but they were in the second position, they can't take the lead. The team which ended up in last in the competion finally won the competion with the same teammates who were blamed by their previous captain for not paddling enough and not winning the competition. From this the instructor just chnaged the leaders of two teams and they can see a drastic change in the team, so from this incident, we can say there is no such things called bad teams, only bad leaders. The team which was loosing continuosly after swapping the leaders they won the competition. The orginial leader of the crew 6 learned a valuable lesson. 

  - Also Leif Babin tried explained this to the CTO of a company which was not doing well where the CTO only blames his managers and workers in the company for the downfall of the company.  Leif Babin tried his best to make the CTO understand the concept of no bad teams only bad leaders but the CTO doesn't accept that and also resist the fact that his decision were bad and didn't work. Where in the other hand the managers and other people who were leading some team aggreed to what Leif Babin said. Then he reported this incident to the CEO of the company that's his CTO refuse to agree and implement the idea and the company continued the state. removing the CTo was hard beacuse he has lots of technical knowledge and it is not very easy to replace the position of CTO. But eventually, CEO parted ways with the CTO and the new CTO was also assigned. The new CTO has same mindset of Leif Babin and made the company in good and profitable company. 

## _Chapter: 3 Beleive_

  - This chapter was written by _Jacko Willink_ and named it as Believe. This chapter mainly focuses on when someone beleives in what they are doing thwy will definetly acheive it. In this context, If we as a leader don't believe in the mission, then how will you expect your team or soldiers who work under you to do the same and give it their all. So first When you start beleive then only the teammates who work under you will beleive and give their soul and heart for the job. Jacko Willink tells a story of how he won a battle with having Iraq soldiers, So he was told that there is a change in startegy by US command that in future missions he need to be run together with the Iraqi Army, and they have to feature Iraqi presence in addition to US personnel. So, the problem is at that time, Iraqi soldiers was known as the worst possible army. Their men were poorly trained, they were uneducated, badly outfittedn and most importantly they were generally uncommitted or unmotivated. He was worried that this might make the situation worse and they may end up getting defeated by the enemies in the battlefield. What he belived initially was actually made sense because the Iraqi soilders where not properly trained for a combact in the field or how to handle the equipments. They are not even trained to follow safety protocols in critical situations, these factors were not only dangerous for the Iraqi soilders it was also dangerous for the US seal unit. Not only they miss the training but also the equipments which are important in a battlefield some of them didn't even have a compass or a radio's with them, which are basic tools a soilder should have in a battlefield. They were also had no knowledge in how to handle the weapons which they use which soilders use that to win in battlefield more importantly if we missuse the weapons it might backfire them and team might ended up loosing their own teammates. Where as in the other hand the seal unit is well trained to win on a battlefield. The seal not only trained on the basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL Training (BUD/S) trainning they all have real time experince in real battlefield which make iraq soilders no match to the us soilders. Jaco was so confused and questioned why would their own higher officilas do this because they are very smart and they have many experience then why would they make a starategy like this they don't want to loose the battle, inorder to win, then why the Iraqi soliers are used, with them in the battlefield we will defenitely loose then why would they do that. After that, he tried to understand the situation he was given, he realized that there was simply no way the Iraqi Army, in its current shape, could run security and defend its own country. But if the US didn’t somehow improve this situation, they would never be able to hand over operations to the Iraqis so that they could eventually withdraw from the conflict. Something needed to change. he told this to his team and they were also not happy about it. He questioned himself about this situation many times. He asked himself why are they even here when the Iraq has it's own army and soilders. Then he understood that the iraqi soilders aren't trained enough to take down these enemies by themself, So they neede the US army help because they were well trained and can handle the battlefield easily. He realized that if thier soilders didn't learn to take down their enemies by themself the US soilders should do that year by year and they would stuck in Iraq for life. So they have to train the Iraqi soldiers and they can easily take down the enemy on their own, Which then Jocko Willink understand that they need to include the iraqi soilders so they will learn and get trained on realtime battlefield. The seal or the US army dosen't have anytime to train them so they have to train them in the battelfield. They will learn it in the battlefield there was no time for practicing, they were putten in a do or die situaution so that they would learn it. Jocko shared his idea with his teammates and they also started to beleive what he said and acted upon it. In the battlefield they Iraqi soldiers struggled a lot, some miss handled the weapons and some soldiers didn't follo the basic safety protocol. The US army were also struggled because of the Iraqi soldiers mistakes and the problem they created, But as time goes they learned it quickly and started to trust each other and worked as a one team. Eventually, having Iraqi soldiers benefited them because they know the local language and they will speak with the locals and they differentiate the locals and enemies, they know the locking mechanism of typical houses. This was really helpful to the US army in the battlefield, the Iraqi soldiers made the US army's job way more easier. They eventually build some bond between them and continued winning on the battlefield. By the end of their deployment, the reduction in enemy strength had caused these areas to become sufficiently safe that they could hand over control to the Iraqi Army, despite their poor training. So here Beleiving plays an important role, They won the battle because the Iraqi soldiers believed in them, the US army beleived in Iraqi soldiers and beleived them. They beleived in the mission. Jocko Willink beleived in the mission given by the higher officials. so beleiving is very important. The second part of this chaapter illustrates this Importance of why with a business case about a change in sales team compensation plans within a comapany. The CEO had a simple plan which changed incentives, aimed at weeding out poor performers and stimulating those who were doing well. But the managers of those teams didn’t understand why they were doing this, which caused them to see only risks and downsides as opposed to the opportunities successful execution would give. Afraid of being seen as incompetent or stupid, none of the managers dared speak up and ask the CEO why she was implementing the change in compensation. Jocko Willink understands the situation and Jocko conveyed this to their CEO and the CEO explained why do they implementing this, their manager understanded the decision taken by the CEO and started beleiving in the mission they started implementing it and they got their desired result. So when someone need to give their best it's important for them to know why they do this, only then they will start belive in what they do and in return they will give their best and get the desired result. So we should always strive to understand why we are being asked to do something and we should make sure the people who work under us should understand why they are being asked to do something.



## _Chapter 4: Check the Ego_

  - This Chapter was written by _Jocko Willink_. This chapter discuss about the problems that having too big of an Ego can have, it explains how controlling our ego can destroy us in in terms of leadership and as a person too. this chapter took place in the Camp Corregidor Ramadi, There will be insurgent attacks on this camp is like an almost daily occurence. So they realized they need to work closely together with regular navy and army units. they should be very careful inorder to survive and be successful, the navy SEAL's did their best like including focus on tidy uniforms and adherence to other Navy SEAL's. A new unit from the US military arrived at Iraq to fight alongside the SEALS. The unit came was the usual US military army which follows strict grooming rules and also wears a proper uniform and they are all well disciplined. Whereas the SEAL has no strict grooming or uniform rules but when they heard the SEAL's also started following the strict rules like grooming and in uniform rule so that they can easily adapt themselves with the new unit in the battlefield. The US military is well trained and they were even better than the SEAL's themself, the weakest or lowest soldier in the new unit is like more experienced when compared with the SEAL's unit. In the battlefield, the new unit started to battle alonside with the SEAL's unit, They were outperforming every SEAL's they were so good, even one of the SEAL commander talked to Jocko Willink about how the new unit battles and might overshadow SEAL's performance, but Jocko Willink controlled his ego and said who is doing well and who is outperforming well isn't important what's important is who wins the battle, at the end of the day only one matters is who wins the battle and survives. The SEAL commander realized his mistake. The new military unit had so much ego, they were a combined US army/Iraqi unit wants to get in on the action. Unlike the vast majority of the Iraqi Army, this was an elite unit with experience and exceptionally good gear. This group was so arrogant and didn't bother fitting in the unit. Instead, they acted like they are elite. The new military unit feels they are the superior to the SEAL and other soilders, in terms of skill and efficiently, which distanced them from other team which resulted in inefficency in the battlefield. They didn't let go of the ego that destroys the unity in the battlefield and affecting them badly in the battlefield. So eventually what happens is the higher officials removed them from the battlefield so that they can bring back the unity and strong effiency in the battlefield or else they might ended up in a situation that could lead to a seriosu incident. In the Business side which was written by _Leif Babin_ shares a story opf a mide level manager who was in a trouble dealing with a highly experienced chief suprevisor but undisciplined member of his team. the Chief Supervisor ordered some part and changed a piece of critical equipement without the knowledge of the manager where as he should have move through the manager first as per the protocol. But the ego of Chief Suprevisor thiniking he is the superior to the manager because he has more experience than the manager in the field which inturn ended up backfiring and set them back thousands of dollars. Leif Babin mentioned it was important to address the situation, but suggested taking extreme ownership here too. Even if the manager felt the other guy made the mistake, as the manager, it happened on his watch, so he was to blame. With the manager taking complete ownership, and bringing this to his employees from this angle, they would help you out from the problem of ego and can keep the employees engaged in resolution. So We have to control our ego inorder to make things work in a good way, even if someone shows ego, tell them with humble, with your humbleness their ego can also go down and they feel bad about what they did it, if you also show ego and this will make the situation worse. We shuldn't ignore the problem we should take ownership of it and address the issue. 


## _Chapter 5: Cover and Move_

  - This Chapter was written by _Leif Babin_. It explains the importanve of teamwork, illustrated against the background of _Cover and Move_ military tactics. It tells you that just focusing on our work and just helping your team alone doesn't win or doesn't make a impact. For an organization there will be several teams and each team will be dependent on one another. So if we help only our team and expect good result, it won't happen because everyother team should perform well, then only it will give a good result or make an impact.They also work for the organization and for the same goal, so helping other team is very important. This will give good result for the organization. Every team work for same goal so by helping other units including them with you and helping each other will boost each other efficiency and shouldn't ignore them. If we say that's not our job, we should focus only in our team, then you will not get the good result for the company. They also work for the same goal. Leif Babin explains it with a real time example in warzone. The seals and other units planned a mission to save the citizens who is under the vision of terrorist region. So, they went to rescue the civilians from the enemy region. In order to do it they need to enter the enemy region and meet the civilans and verify them that they are civilians or a terrorist. They can't make much noice as they don't want to enter in a gun fire with their enemeis at their base because there are civilians to in that area, so we shouldn't use guns and weapons. Although some will defienetly notice and will attack the SEAL, so inorder to protect the team they have set the SEAL snippers in the tall building some meters away from the war zone. There were two SEAL SNiper units called as OP1 and OP2. They provide cover ad overwatch for US army and Iraqi soldiers. OP1 was situated 300 meters away from the miltary base, and OP2 had a position much further out which required them to move into place under the cover of darkness ahead of the mission. The operation ends up being a success and both OP1 and OP2 withdraw back to base afterwards. The other unit accompanied by Jocko Willink have completed their work without any problem, so the snipper of their team had no work, but on the other hand the other unit accompanied Leif Babin got into problem the terrorist were surrounding them and was in a crucial situation in the battle field while OP2 trying his best to protect them. In the end Leif's team finally left the battlefield without any casualities. The first question Jocko asked Leif Babin is why didn't they use their team which is OP1 who was available, they would have helped Leif team and there wouldn't be a tough situation. Leif Babin understood that he made a mistake and he had put his team in a danger situation by not utilizing their resources to their best. It's not like the snipper didn't respond but Leif Babin didn't ask for help even though he know OP1 is available. Leif Babin didn't take such decision because he was focued on the battle field too much but he could have easen the situation by calling the Op1 unit. That would have maken the situation ease and his teammates would have been more safer. This applies to business also, because we have to do teamworkmnot only with our department but also with other departments. Instead of thinking only about your own team or your own department, consider the teams you depend on or who depend on you. then only our goal or the company's goal can be acheived.


## _Chapter 6: Simple_  

  - This Chapeter was written by _Jacko Willink_. In this chapter Jocko Willink explains how to keep things simple will leds to effective way of execution also how simple comunication can become an effective communication. He told two stories in chapter 6 about simple. The first is set during the first days of combat outpost (COP) Falcon being established and the first patrols outside the confines of its (relative) safety. The surgents had lobbed 120mm mortar rounds. It illustrates how a new, inexperienced commander proposes a foot patrol which would take it through 3 different sectors, operated by two different army units and one marine unit, all with their own radio nets and standard operating procedures. The surgents attacked their base with motors and rocket launchers. During in this kinda situation, we shouldn't rage, we should stay calm and keep focusing on our work i.e., make it simple. Jocko Willink knows how to handle this situation and he communicated with the team with simple and crystal clear, so that the team mates can easily understand and they were also stayed calm. They communicated easily with one another with simple, clear and crisp conversation. Jacko keep it simple he knows having multiple teams will make the sitiation worse and he convinced the commander to stick to a shorter path. the second part is in the business aspect, The business story discusses about the bonus scheme introduced by the CEO which is very tough to understand. Because of its complexity, none of the people in the company understand how they receive or qualify for a bonus, which leads to lack of engagement. So Jocko Willink reported it to the CEO about the complexity in the bonus scheme and  she agreed that it's complex. Then jocko explained why it's important to keep it simple then she understood and changed the plan to more simpler and communicated it clearly to the employees which resulted in increased efficiency in their production and also employees got an opportunity to earn more money which was a win win situation for both employees and company.


## _Chapter 7: Prioritize and Execute_

  - This Chapter was written by _Leif Babin_. He begins with a story from battlefield in Iraq where they entered deep into enemy territory with multiple SEAL units, EOD technicians and Iraqi military under his command. They were in a 4-story building and engaged in numerous firefights throughout the day. When it was time to leave under the cover of dusk, they discovered a serious problem - the enemy had planted an IED near the single exit of the building. To escape safely, they used a sledgehammer to break through a second-story wall to reach the roof of an adjacent single-story building. While exiting, one SEAL member fell through the roof, landing 20 feet below with no way to defend himself. The only way to reach him was through a narrow stairway blocked by a locked steel door, and they were surrounded by well-armed Muj fighters. The situation was critical and dangerous. This is where the importance of "Prioritize and Execute" came into play. Leif Babin tells us how his training instilled in him the need to prioritize the most pressing issues and then execute them one by one. They used the principle "Relax, look around, make a call" to handle the situation. First, he ordered to "Set security" - positioning men, especially the SEAL machine gunners, to cover everyone. Next, he sent a breacher to get through the locked gate, and finally ordered his leading petty officer to do a headcount to ensure everyone made it out of the original building safely. The SEAL who fell through the roof fortunately landed on his backpack and wasn't seriously injured. Everyone made it back to base safely.

  - The business application of this principle was demonstrated through a story about a CEO of a pharmaceutical company. The company had been expanding greatly but started experiencing declining revenue trends. The CEO and executives prepared a "State of the Company" brief with various initiatives to improve the situation. When asked for his opinion, Jocko questioned if they had heard of the term "Decisively Engaged" and pointed out that implementing too many initiatives simultaneously would create "a whole lot of battles going on." He asked which initiative had the highest priority. The CEO identified activity management of their sales forces as the most critical - ensuring their sales people were engaged in the right activities. Without effective sales, none of the other initiatives would matter. Having multiple initiatives running simultaneously would distract from this core initiative and leave other departments shorthanded. Instead of tackling everything at once, the CEO focused solely on the activity management of their sales force, making it clear to the entire company that this was their highest priority. This focused approach quickly showed progress and built momentum. What I understand from this chapter is when we take on too many tasks or initiatives at once, we will likely become overwhelmed trying to manage them all. This not only affects our focus but also impacts everyone involved, potentially leaving people shorthanded. The key lesson is to focus on the most important thing first and defer the rest. In critical situations, we need to stay calm, assess the situation, prioritize the most immediate threats or needs, and execute them one by one. This approach works effectively both in life-or-death military situations and in business settings. I will try to implement this principle of "Prioritize and Execute" in my daily life when dealing with multiple tasks or challenges.


## _Chapter 8: Decentralized Command_

  - This Chapter was written by _Jocko Willink_. It explains Decentralized Command which is an important leadership principle. As humans, we can only lead about 6 to 10 people effectively. When leaders get too caught up in small details, they can't see the big picture anymore. This is why we need hierarchy where senior leaders guide junior leaders who run their own teams. Decentralized Command and Commander's Intent are key concepts in this chapter. Junior leaders need to understand why they're doing certain tasks and how their work fits into the bigger strategy. They should be allowed to make their own choices and have their leaders back them up. This only works when everyone knows their responsibilities and which decisions they can make on their own versus when they need to ask someone higher up. One risk with Decentralized Command is teams might work independently without knowing what other teams are doing, which could cause problems like the friendly fire incident mentioned in the combat story. To avoid this, information needs to flow both up and down the chain of command. Lower-level team members should tell higher-ups about plan changes, and leaders should keep their teams informed about changing situations and what other units are doing. In the example, a SEAL team changed location because their original building wasn't right for the mission. This kind of change needs to be shared up the chain so everyone stays coordinated. Decentralized Command needs clear direction from the top and good communication throughout. What I understand is that good leadership means creating teams of manageable size, clearly defining who can make which decisions, explaining the overall goals so teams can adapt while staying on track, and making sure information flows both ways. This helps organizations be disciplined but also flexible. Breaking big departments into smaller teams of 5-6 people with clear leaders improves execution and accountability. I see how this works in both military operations and business where complex tasks need multiple teams working toward the same goal. I'll try to use this when I work in teams.


## _Chapter 9: Plan_

  - This Chapter was written by _Leif Babin_. He tells about a hostage rescue mission in Iraq where they got last-minute intel about possible IEDs and machine gun nests. The team joked "Looks like we're going to get some today" and went ahead anyway. They rescued the hostage successfully without facing those threats because they surprised the enemy. What's interesting is this scenario is now used in SEAL training. Many trainees say they would abort the mission with this new intel, but Leif argues we should always plan for worst-case scenarios from the start. If you prepare for the worst, you're ready for anything.

  - The chapter also talks about PowerPoint problems. For their final training exercise, they had to brief the commanding officer who would decide which teams deploy to Iraq. Leif and his team made complex slides that didn't focus enough on execution. Jocko advised them: "Forget about fancy PowerPoint. Make sure your own platoon understands the plan. The true test isn't impressing senior officers but whether your troops understand the operation." Following this advice, they simplified everything, used real maps they'd carry in the field, and let subordinate leaders explain their parts. Surprisingly, the CO praised their brief as the clearest he'd heard, and their team was selected for Iraq deployment. What I understand is that good planning needs clear objectives first. We should delegate planning to people who'll execute it when possible. We should always think about what could go wrong and make backup plans. The key isn't fancy presentations but making sure everyone understands their role. This works both in military and business situations.


## _Chapter 10: Leading Up and Down the Chain of Command_

  - This Chapter was written by Leif Babin. It focuses on the effective flow of information up and down the chain of command. After returning from Iraq deployment, Leif was frustrated and angry, wondering if their efforts made any difference. He heard rumors and criticism from other teams saying they took too many risks, which annoyed him because these people weren't on the ground risking their lives daily. When Jocko prepared a presentation for the chief of naval operations showing Ar Ramadi before and after their arrival, things clicked for Leif. He finally understood why their missions were important and how they contributed to the bigger picture. Both Jocko and Leif realized they failed as leaders by not explaining this better to their teams during the deployment. They noticed something interesting - SEAL operators who became disillusioned were those least involved in planning, while those who remained motivated were the ones who participated in planning, even if just a small part. Those more involved understood the intent and goals better.

  - The chapter also talks about leading up the chain. Leif was frustrated with higher command constantly asking questions about their operations. Questions like "Did you coordinate an appropriate QRF?" seemed insulting because they would never operate without a Quick Reaction Force in dangerous Ramadi. These email chains took valuable time away from mission planning. Jocko helped Leif see things from their commanding officer's perspective. The CO was in Fallujah, a more stable region, and had to approve every mission and defend these decisions to higher-ups without knowing what Ramadi was like. Their missions weren't getting approved easily because they weren't pushing enough information up the chain. Taking ownership of this problem, they started sending detailed mission planning documents and post-operation reports up the chain. They invited their CO and command staff to visit and join combat operations. As they passed more information upward, the command staff better understood their goals and risk mitigation strategies, which built trust and led to all their combat missions getting approved. From this chapter, I understand that good leaders must communicate effectively both up and down the chain of command. Explaining the bigger picture to your team gives them purpose and motivation. Similarly, providing detailed information to your superiors builds trust and understanding, making it easier to get support for your operations. This applies both in military and business settings.    







- After this I have two more chapters to finish due to personal reasons I couldn't finish but I will finsih it soon. I had a wonderful experience with this book, I have learned a lot from this book. I learned how to be a good leader and take responsibility instead of blaming others. Usually, I am not a fan of reading books, but this book has made a huge differnce and I loved reading this book. I learned a lot and I will use this learnings in my day to day world at the end of the day its how you seal _LEAD_ and _WIN_.
