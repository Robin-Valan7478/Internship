# _DAY 29 @ SURFBOARD PAYMENTS:_


## _INVESTMENTS SESSION:_


   - Today, I had the great oppurtunity of getting to know how to invest my amount properly, where and all I can invest my amount, What are all the options are there to invest our amount. I had a question from starting Is it safe to invest in the share market will it be profitable and i don't know how share market works. i asked lot of my friends who invest in share market, but I didn't get a clear view of it, but I get to know what share market is.

   - Kugesh Anna gave a clear explanation of Investments i.e., how to invest our amount based on the earnings we have, how to properly invest starting from scratch. 

   - There are many ways to invest our amount. We can invest in Lands, apartments, Gold, FD's, etc. I had a great learning in this session, which platform is best for investment.

   - _REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS:_ Investing in properties like land, apartments to earn rental income. It requires high capital, long term commitent. It's a long term investmant.

   - _FIXED DEPOSITS:_ Fixed deposits(FD's) are a safe investments offered by banks with a fixed interest rate for a specific period. We should invest only with national accretated banks only. This Fixed Deposits has low risks, guranteed returns. The problem is it has lower returns compared to other investments.

   - _GOLD:_ Gold Investment is like a traditional investment. It can be held physically or even digitally. It offers moderate returns and can easily turn the gold in cash.

   - _Business Investments:_ Business Investments means putting money into a company to help it grow and in return for a share of the companies profits or value increase over time. There are four stages of business investment:

   - _EARLY STAGE:_ It's like Pre Seed or Seed stage which means for example buying stocks in our own money or buying it from friends and family.

   - _GROWTH STAGE:_ It's like Series A/B which mean investing in growing startups. We can take Kallari capital as example. So it's basically a comapnt that gives money to startups or business that are already running and showing potential growth.

   - _LATE STAGE:_ At this stage, we can inveest in companies that generates consistent revenue. These are foten called Series C. We can take Blackstone as a example, it is a global private equity and investment firm that invests in large, well established business preparing for IPO or expansion. So basically they buy equity in private companies that are close to going public which is known as pre IPO. softBank Vison Fund and Tiger Global are also other common late stage investors.

   - _PUBLIC STAGE:_ In this Public stage, once the company completes its IPO and then its shares are listed on a stock exchange like NSE(National Stock Exchange) and BSE(Bombay Stock Exchange). So now anyone can buy or sell the shares in the market.

   - _DIY STOCK INVESTMENTS:_ its like directl investments in stock aftr our own research about the copany. We can have high potential returns but it also involves significant risks. It requires market knowledge and what's happening around the world and we should regularly monitor it.

   - _MUTUAL FUND INVESTMENTS:_ It is like a money pool where many people put their money together. that money is managed by a fund mnager who invest that amount in stocks, bonds or gold to earn returns. It's like experts invest our amount for us.


 ## _SIGNUP AUTHENTICATION:_

   - My task was to check if the user enters a details which is already stored i.e., if the user tries to sign up with a email ID which is already registered then it should throw a error saying Email ID registered.

   - So in my sign up page dart file I created a value notifer called as isRegistered in bool return type and initially assigned the value false. 

   - Inside the Sign in button assigned a new bool variable called result and stored the values given from authentication page. if it is a new email ID it pushes the sign up page to home page. If the email Id is already registered then it shows Email ID already registered.
